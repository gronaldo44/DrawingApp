This project was created using mostly Kotlin. Some code was written in C++ and called via Kotlin's "external fun" syntax. Users can create a profile that is saved and safely managed on the cloud. Users can save their drawings to the cloud and access the libraries of others on the cloud. However, users can only read from other libraries and write to their own library. Users can also save any drawings they access locally to their devices to update, view, or upload in the future.
